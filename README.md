# Batch MKV to MP4 Converter with Frame Rate Fix

This Python script is designed to convert MKV video files to MP4 format while also fixing potential issues with variable frame rates. The conversion is achieved using FFmpeg, a powerful multimedia framework, and the frame rate correction is done using the `mp4fpsmod` tool. Additionally, the script utilizes the `pymediainfo` library to extract video file information.

## Features
- Converts MKV files to MP4 format.
- Corrects variable frame rates for better compatibility.
- Organizes converted files in a 'Converted' folder.
- Provides informative console output for each file processed.

## Prerequisites
Before using this script, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- **Python**: You need Python installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

- **FFmpeg**: Make sure FFmpeg is installed and accessible from the command line. You can download FFmpeg from [FFmpeg's official website](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html).

- **mp4fpsmod**: This tool is used for fixing variable frame rates. You should have it in the same directory as the script. You can download and install it from [here](https://github.com/nu774/mp4fpsmod).

- **pymediainfo**: Install the `pymediainfo` Python library using pip:

```bash
pip install pymediainfo
```
- You might need to add the **libmediainfo.0.dylib** file to the folder.

## How to Use

1. Place your MKV files in the same directory as the mkvtomp4.py script.

2. Ensure that the `mp4fpsmod` executable is in the same directory as the script. You can rename it to `mp4fpsmod` if needed.

3. Run the script using the following command:

```bash
python mkvtomp4.py
```

4. The script will process each MKV file in the directory, converting it to MP4 and fixing the frame rate.

5. Converted files will be stored in a 'Converted' folder within the script's directory.

6. The script will display information about the conversion process, including successful and unsuccessful conversions.

7. After processing all files, you will see a summary of the conversion results.

8. Press Enter to finish and exit the script.

## Notes

- The script assumes that the input files are in MKV format and that `mp4fpsmod` is available in the same directory. Make sure to adjust the script accordingly if you have different requirements.

- The script uses `pymediainfo` to extract frame rate information from the MKV files. If you encounter issues with frame rate detection, ensure that your MKV files have valid metadata.

- This script may not cover all possible edge cases, so it's essential to test it with your specific MKV files and adjust it as needed.

## Disclaimer

Use this script at your own risk. Ensure you have the necessary rights and permissions to convert and modify video files.
